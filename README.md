# LSTM-Stock-Predictions
The name of our project is Stock Flow. We want to predict stock prices using historical market data and whether or not a stock is a good investment. The dataset includes key features such as opening price, closing price, high and low prices, adjusted close prices, and trading volume. Using different ML algorithms we aim to assist investors in making informed decisions about potential future stock prices. Our data is taken from the kaggle dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset. Before jumping into which ML models we wanted to use we had to do data visualization and cleaning steps. By toggling around in the kaggle dataset we were able to get a good feel for what information was given for each stock and what each file consisted of. Our dataset has more than 8,000 files so we had to decide how we wanted to work with it. We thought it would be smart to develop machine learning models that will inform brokers of decisions and have the ability to import the names of different stocks to get the output of specific stocks. This way, instead of us performing 8,000 times and having a messy dataset, we can give value to stock brokers by allowing them to input what they want. This led us to clean the data so that it was not all over the place and we could start with just a few stocks at a time.
